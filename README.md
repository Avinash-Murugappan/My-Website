## Inspiration

I have always wanted to build a cool website with react. As a starting point I decided to look out for templates, so I can learn by playing with the underlying code. Thanks [brittanychiang.com](https://brittanychiang.com) for the inspiration. This code is based of her project. I really learnt a ton from this project and hope to keep learning new tech.
